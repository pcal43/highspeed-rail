/**
 * Config file for Highspeed Rail:
 *  https://modrinth.com/mod/highspeed-rail
 *
 * This default configuration file sets your world up to have fast minecarts
 * when the rails are built on gravel blocks.  In normal worlds, minecarts
 * on gravel will travel up to 40 blocks-per-second; in worlds with the
 * experimental 'Minecart Improvements' enabled, carts on gravel will travel
 * at 200 blocks-per-second.
 *
 * There's a lot you can tweak here, though, so read on.
 *
 *
 * MINECART PHYSICS MODELS
 *
 * The mod supports both the classic minecart physics model as well as the
 * new experimental model introduced in minecraft 1.21.3.  Some config
 * settings only apply to the new physics model.  The mod provides an option
 * to enable the new model even in old worlds.
 *
 *
 * EDITING AND MANAGING THIS FILE
 *
 * That this file is not actually json5 - it's parsed with minecraft's
 * built-in json parser in lenient mode, mainly to make it ignore comments
 * like this one.  The lie with the .json5 extension just helps text editors
 * happy.
 *
 * The default config file will automatically get created during Minecraft
 * startup if it doesn't exist.  If you get stuck with configuration errors,
 * you can start over by renaming this file to 'highspeed-rail.json5.old'
 * and then restarting Minecraft.

 * The configuration format sometimes changes with new versions of the mod.
 * Reasonable efforts are made to preserve backwards compatibility.  But you
 * may want to regenerate the default config after updating if you run into
 * problems or want to take advantage of new features.

   * 'Minecart Improvements' enabled.  As of Minecraft 1.24.3, the new physics
   * model is experimental and may result in unexpected behavior.
   *
   * The new physics model is vastly better than the old, and it's pretty
   * unlikely that this could cause world corruption, so you'll probably be
   * happy with the results of turning this on.  Nonetheless, you do so at
